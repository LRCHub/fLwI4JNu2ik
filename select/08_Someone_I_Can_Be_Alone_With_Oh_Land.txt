One second, one second at a time
It's all I, it's all I can do now

I am facing a change that has left me blinded
With no skills to navigate
My head is exploding in slow motion
While I'm making sense of it

Try not to worry about me
I need just time to help me
Try not to push for an answer
Still meaningless

But when I'm catching my breath
You'll be someone I can be alone with

A state of, a state of urgency
I broke out, I broke out of the dream

The debris of my actions blur the image
Slur the sequence out of pitch
My head is exploding in slow motion
While I'm making sense of it

Try not to worry about me
I need just time to help me
Try not to push for an answer
Still meaningless

But when I'm catching my breath
You'll be someone I can be alone with
