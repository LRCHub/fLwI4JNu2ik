If I have to be alone
Then I should make my mind serene
After all you're born alone, you die alone
You might as well spend every moment in between alone

But if I have to be alone
Then it will be on my own terms
I can never talk about it, ever show it
Even though the world is watching while I squirm alone

And your bleeding heart friends say, "isn't it sad? "
Then they go make love
While you go insane. insane!
It drives you mad! mad!

My mind, I love my mind
And if no one can feel the same
I'm a computer with a name
And I've got no one else to blame
If I have to be alone

And if nobody understands
That special creature that is me
And if they fail to see the me I see
Then no one else knows truly what it is
To be alone

Maybe once in a lifetime you lose your will
Then you can let down your guard
But they cower in fear. in fear.
It makes you ill! ill!

My heart, my burning heart
And if no one will quench the flame
I'm not obliged to do the same
And then they'll have to share the blame
Because I have to be alone
Because I have to be alone
But I don't want to be alone
