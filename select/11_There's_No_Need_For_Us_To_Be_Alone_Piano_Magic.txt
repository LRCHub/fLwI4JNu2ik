I can't believe she said that
Can't believe it's true
Can't believe she's faithful,
She is wicked through and through
She's read too many books
She's had too many screws
Unfortunately i have fallen don't know what to do
When spring turned to summer, i swapped her for another
She drank herself stupid
Threw herself down the stairs
She put whiskey with her aspirin
My records in the dustbin
She pleaded me to take her back
I knew she would, i knew she would
Want without needing
Love without leaning
Hold without clinging
Don't suffocate, don't suffocate
She wore a coat too warm for summer
Socks too short for winter
Shoes too scuffed for parties
And lipstick far too tarty
She wanted without needing
She loved without leaning
She held without clinging
But she suffocates, she suffocates
There's no need for us to be alone anymore
There's no need for us to be alone anymore
She wanted without needing
She loved without leaning
She held without clinging
She suffocates, she suffocates
She wanted without needing
She loved without leaning
She held without clinging
But she suffocates, she suffocates
